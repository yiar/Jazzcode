We spent a lot of time creating a squarespace [website](https://kazoo-oleander-d6cc.squarespace.com/?p) but the teacher deleted it without asking if we had backed it up...

 <br/><br/>

## Main benefits
- Effective learning by spaced repetition practice for musicians, which is easy to add to your already existing routine
- More easily recall new passcodes in melodies, which allows for changing password more often to make you more secure
- Personalization. Chose a melody you love to use as passcode.

## Why was Jazzcode made?

A challenge to innovate a user authentication interaction from a school course in Mobile computing.
A few different options were available in the course. We choose this combination:

Challenge: Digital Authentication and Access
Approach: Design for the Real World (aka. actually making an app that works, even if very limited functionality)

The scope wasn't that big, so we didn't have time to make the package modular so other apps could use it.
The long-term idea was for the authentication method to be able to be used in multiple apps, perhaps music apps that musicians regularly use. To demonstrate Jazzcode we made a simple example app idea it could be applied to which would let a musician store private lyrics they're working on.

The course also had a big focus in generating different ideas, iterating, not just make the application. Our process of generating and presenting these ideas can be read about in the /process folder.

# Installation

## Virtual device:

- Clone the repo
- Open the project in android studios
- Select AVD manager
- Create virtual device
- Category phone, select a device (Pixel 4 XL has been used)
- Select API level(29 has been used for this project)
- Build and run

## Physical device:
- Clone the repo
- Open the project in android studios
- Select avd amanger
- Select device
- Build and run


# How to use the prototype
When the app has been built and runs, the first time you should set a password that is 4-15 characters long.
When you successfully set a password you will be sent to the previous activity. 
Press log in and enter your new password.
If the password has been entered successfully you will unlock the app. You can press the little lock to set a new password at this point or simply enjoy the lyrics.
